The Euclidean Algorithm is an ancient and fundamental algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.

** Here's how the Euclidean Algorithm works: **

- Start with two non-negative integers, a and b, where a is greater than or equal to b.
- Divide a by b and get the remainder, r.
- Replace a with b and replace b with r.
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until b becomes 0. The GCD is the non-zero remainder from the last division.
