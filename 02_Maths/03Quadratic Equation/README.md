# Quadratic Equation
A quadratic equation is a second-degree polynomial equation in a single variable, typically written in the form:

$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$

Where:

-   a, b, and c are constants.
-   x is the variable we're solving for.
-   The equation can have two real roots, one real root, or two complex roots.

**Finding Quadratic Equation Roots:** 
To find the roots of a quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula, which is:

$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
